\section*{10 Hypothesis Testing and p-values}

\subsection*{Solution 6.}

I'm not sure if I understand the question correctly.
Phillips and King are interested in testing the null hypothesis $\theta \leq \frac{1}{2}$, not $\theta = \frac{1}{2}$.
The first one is statistically significant, the latter is not as you will see in the solution.

We can use the Wald test.
The null hypothesis $H_0: \theta_0 = \frac{1}{2}$.
Let $n = 1919$.
We estimate $\hat{\theta} = \frac{922}{n} \approx 0.48$.
Note that
$$
\mathrm{Var}(\theta_0)
    = \mathrm{Var}(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i)
    = \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{i=1}^n \mathrm{Var}(X_i)
    = \frac{1}{n^2} n \theta_0 (1 - \theta_0)
    = \frac{1}{4n}
$$
as $X_i \sim \mathrm{Bin}(n, \theta_0)$ and $\theta_0 = \frac{1}{2}$.
Wald's test statistic is then given by
$$
W = \frac{\hat{\theta} - \theta_0}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}(\theta_0)}}
    = 2\sqrt{n} (\hat{\theta} - \theta_0)
    \approx -1.75.
$$
The p-value is $2\Phi(|W|) \approx 0.08$.
So we do not reject the null-hypothesis.

The confidence interval for which we reject the null-hypothesis is
$$
C = (\hat{\theta} - \hat{se} z_{0.025}, \hat{\theta} + \hat{se} z_{0.025})
    = (0.480, 0.503),
$$
as $\hat{se} = \sqrt{\hat{\theta}(1 - \hat{\theta})/n}$.

\subsection*{Solution 6. Alternative solution}

We can calculate the probability directly from the biomial distribution.
The null hypothese $H_0: \theta_0 = \frac{1}{2}$.
Under $H_0$, $X \sim \mathrm{Bin}(n, \theta_0)$, where $n = 1919$.
Then the p-value is $P(X \geq 922) + P(X \leq 1919/2 - 37.5) \approx 0.087$.
So we don't reject the null-hypothesis.

We reject the null-hypothesis if
$$
    X \notin (z_{0.025}, z_{0.975}) = (917, 1002).
$$


\subsection*{Solution 7}

See code for explicit calculations.

(a) We use the Wald test on $H_0: \overline{\Delta} = \overline{X} - \overline{Y} = 0$, where $X$ are the measurements of Twain and $Y$ the measurements of Snodgrass.
The Wald test gives us a p-value of approximately $0.00008$, so we reject the null hypothesis that the essays of Twain and Snodgrass are the same.
The confidence interval of $\overline{\Delta}$ is aproximately $(0.011, 0.033)$.

(b) Using the permutation test on $T(X_1, ..., X_8, Y_1, ..., Y_{10}) = |\overline{X} - \overline{Y}|$.
The approximate p-value is $0.00089$.
We reject the null hypothesis that the distributions of $X$ and $Y$ are the same.
