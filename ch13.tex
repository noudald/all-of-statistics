\subsection*{Solution 13.1}

I tried to calculate the equations directly from the formula, but it's significantly easier to do it with matrix differentiation.
Therefore, we develop a set of matrix differentiation tools.

For the rest of this section, let $\psi: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$, $\bm{x} \in \mathbb{R}^m$ and $\bm{y} \in \mathbb{R}^n$, such that $\bm{y} = \bm{y}(\bm{x}) = \psi(\bm{x})$.
We define
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\partial \psi(\bm{x})}{\partial \bm{x}}
        = \frac{\partial \bm{y}}{\partial \bm{x}}
        = \left( \frac{\partial y_i}{\partial x_j} \right)_{\substack{1 \leq i \leq m \\ 1 \leq j \leq n}}
        = \left( \begin{matrix}
            \frac{\partial y_1}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial y_1}{\partial x_2} & \ldots & \frac{\partial y_1}{\partial x_n} \\
            \frac{\partial y_2}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial y_2}{\partial x_2} & \ldots & \frac{\partial y_2}{\partial x_n} \\
            \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
            \frac{\partial y_m}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial y_m}{\partial x_2} & \ldots & \frac{\partial y_m}{\partial x_n}
        \end{matrix} \right)
        \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}.
\end{equation*}


\begin{theorem} \label{md1}
If $\psi = A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, such that $\bm{y}(\bm{x}) = A\bm{x}$, and $A$ is independent of $\bm{x}$, then $\frac{\partial \bm{y}}{\partial \bm{x}} = A$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We have $y_i = \sum_{j = 1}^n a_{ij} x_j$, so $\frac{\partial y_i}{\partial x_j} = a_{ij}$, and therefore, $\frac{\partial \bm{y}}{\partial \bm{x}} = A$.
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem} \label{md2}
Let $\bm{y}(\bm{x}, \bm{z}) = A\bm{x}(\bm{z})$, where $\bm{x}$ is a vector values function in vector $\bm{z}$, and $A$ is independent of $\bm{x}$ and $\bm{z}$, then $\frac{\partial \bm{y}}{\partial \bm{z}} = A \frac{\partial \bm{x}}{\partial \bm{z}}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We have $y_i = \sum_{j = 1}^n a_{ij} x_j(\bm{z})$, so $\frac{\partial y_i}{\partial z_j} = \sum_{k = 1}^n a_{ik} \frac{\partial x_k}{\partial z_j} = \left(A \frac{\partial \bm{x}}{\partial \bm{z}}\right)_{ij}$.
Hence, $\frac{\partial \bm{y}}{\partial \bm{z}} = A \frac{\partial \bm{x}}{\partial \bm{z}}$.
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem} \label{md3}
Let $\alpha(\bm{x}, \bm{y}) = \bm{y}^t A \bm{x}$ be a real valued function, where $A$ is a matrix indepedent of $\bm{x}$ and $\bm{y}$.
We have $\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial \bm{x}} = \bm{y}^t A$ and $\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial \bm{y}} = (A \bm{x})^t$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $\bm{z}^t = \bm{y}^t A$, so that $\alpha = \bm{z}^t \bm{x}$.
By Theorem \ref{md1} we have $\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial \bm{x}} = \bm{z}^t = \bm{y}^t A$.
Because $\alpha$ is a scalar, $\alpha = \alpha^t = \bm{x}^t A \bm{y}$.
Applying the same method for $\bm{x}^t A$ we get $\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial \bm{y}} = \frac{\partial \alpha^t}{\partial \bm{y}} = \bm{x}^t A^t = (A \bm{x})^t$.
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem} \label{md4}
Let $\alpha(\bm{x}) \bm{x}^t A \bm{x}$, where $A$ is independent of $\bm{x}$, then $\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial \bm{x}} = \bm{x}^t(A + A^t)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We have $\alpha(\bm{x}) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \sum_{j = 1}^n x_i \alpha_{ij} x_j$, so $\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial x_k} = \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i \alpha_{ik} + \sum_{j = 1}^n x_j \alpha_{kj} = \left(\bm{x}^t (A + A^t)\right)_{k}$.
\end{proof}

Directly from Theorem \ref{md4} we have,

\begin{theorem} \label{md5}
If $A$ is symmetic, i.e., $A^t = A$, then $\frac{\partial}{\partial \bm{x}} \bm{x}^t A \bm{x} = 2 \bm{x}^t A$.
\end{theorem}


\begin{theorem} \label{md6}
Let $\alpha(\bm{x}, \bm{y}, \bm{z}) = \bm{y}(\bm{z})^t \bm{x}(\bm{z})$, then $\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial \bm{z}} = \bm{x}^t \frac{\partial \bm{y}}{\partial \bm{z}} + \bm{y}^t \frac{\partial \bm{x}}{\partial \bm{z}}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We have $\alpha(\bm{x}, \bm{y}, \bm{z}) = \sum_{i = 1}^n y_i(\bm{z}) x_i(\bm{z})$, so $\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial z_j} = \sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{\partial y_j}{\partial z_j} x_i + \sum_{i = 1}^n y_i \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial z_j}$.
Hence $\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial \bm{z}} = \bm{x}^t \frac{\partial \bm{y}}{\partial \bm{z}} + \bm{y}^t \frac{\partial \bm{x}}{\partial \bm{z}}$.
\end{proof}


Directly from Theorem \ref{md6} we have,

\begin{theorem} \label{md7}
    Let $\alpha(\bm{x}, \bm{z}) = \bm{x}(\bm{z})^t \bm{x}(\bm{z})$, then $\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial \bm{z}} = 2 \bm{x}^t \frac{\partial \bm{x}}{\partial \bm{z}}$.
\end{theorem}


\begin{theorem} \label{md8}
    Let $\alpha(\bm{x}, \bm{y}, \bm{z}) = \bm{y}(\bm{z})^t A \bm{x}(\bm{z})$, where $A$ is independent of $\bm{x}$ and $\bm{y}$, then $\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial \bm{z}} = \bm{x}(\bm{z})^t A^t \frac{\partial \bm{y}}{\bm{z}} + \bm{y}(\bm{z})^t A \frac{\partial \bm{x}}{\partial \bm{z}}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Let $\bm{w}(\bm{z}) = A^t \bm{y}(\bm{z})$, such that $\alpha(\bm{x}, \bm{z}, \bm{w}) = \bm{w}(\bm{z})^t \bm{x}(\bm{z})$.
    By Theorem \ref{md2}, $\frac{\partial \bm{w}}{\partial \bm{z}} = A^t \frac{\partial \bm{y}^t}{\partial \bm{z}}$.
    By Theorem \ref{md6}, $\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial \bm{z}} = \bm{x}(\bm{z})^t \frac{\partial \bm{w}}{\partial \bm{z}} + \bm{w}(\bm{z})^t \frac{\partial \bm{x}}{\partial \bm{z}} = \bm{x}(\bm{z})^t A^t \frac{\partial \bm{y}(\bm{z})}{\bm{z}} + \bm{y}(\bm{z})^t A \frac{\partial \bm{x}(\bm{z})}{\partial \bm{z}}$.
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem} \label{md9}
    Let $\alpha(\bm{x}, \bm{z}) = \bm{x}(\bm{z})^t A \bm{x}$, where $A$ is independent of $\bm{x}$, then $\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial \bm{z}} = \bm{x}(\bm{z}) (A + A^t) \frac{\partial \bm{x}}{\partial \bm{z}}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Directly from Theorem \ref{md8}.
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem} \label{md10}
    Let $\alpha(\bm{x}, \bm{z}) = \bm{x}(\bm{z})^t A \bm{x}$, where $A$ is independent of $\bm{x}$.
    If $A$ is symmetric, i.e., $A^t = A$, then $\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial \bm{z}} = 2 \bm{x}^t A \frac{\partial \bm{x}}{\partial \bm{z}}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Directly from Theorem \ref{md9}
\end{proof}
