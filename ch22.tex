\subsection*{Solution 22.1}

Suppose there is an $h$ such that $L(h) < L(h^*)$, then
\begin{equation*}
    \int_0^1 P(h(x) = Y | X = x) P(x) dx > \int_0^1 P(h^*(x) = Y | X = x) P(x) dx.
\end{equation*}
With sufficient properties on the distribution there is an $x$ such that $P(h(x) = Y | X = x) > P(h^*(x) = Y | X = x)$.
But this contradicts the choice of $h^*$.
